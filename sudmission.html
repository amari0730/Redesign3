        <p>For the majority of this redesign I wanted to utalize the color scheme to draw the users attention better. TO ensure that the buttons stood out 
            when they are being hovered, or that when the different sections of the website stood out. I also used a contextualized approach when addressing
            the website. In other words, I ensured that the website would look and act like a normal website. This includes adding links to the top of the
            webpage and as i said before, ensuring that each section, including the header had its proper distinctions. </p>
